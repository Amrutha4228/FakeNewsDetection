Abstract—Detection of Fake News in the age where fake news gets a boom across digital platforms faster than wildfire is essential. In this study, an effective model to detect fake news is
introduced that involves a fusion of advanced feature extraction techniques and complex machine learning classifiers. It uses both:Count vectorisation–The count of the frequency of occurrence
for each word, TF-IDF weight to scale rare words.Instead it roots common and frequent tokens by their inherent importance. In order to improve the detection accuracy, this study merges
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), XGBoost, CatBoost and Bagging in addition LSTM networks. At the other hand, it allows for studying linguistic nuances and contextual signals in news
content through a combination of both shallow text analysis as well deep learning techniques. These results showed that this approach boost the classification performance by a large margin
reducing all kinds of errors allowing at the same time high precision to discern between what is fake and real news. This study is important to the global struggle against misinformation
and demonstrates advanced ML can help retain veracity of information on digital platforms.
